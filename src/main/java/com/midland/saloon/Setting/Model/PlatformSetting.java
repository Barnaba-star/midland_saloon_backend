/**
 * The numbers that run the platform itself, as opposed to one saloon.
 *
 * Exactly one row: these are not per-branch, and a single row keeps them
 * typed and validated rather than a bag of strings. Every default below is
 * the value that was previously hard-coded, so turning this on changes
 * nothing until somebody edits it - with one deliberate exception, trialDays,
 * which closes the hole where a branch that was never given a plan used the
 * system free forever.
