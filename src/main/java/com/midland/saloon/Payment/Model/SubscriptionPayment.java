/**
 * One row per subscription payment that actually completed - the history
 * the branches table cannot hold, since every payment overwrites the same
 * open/close/status columns there.
 *
 * Staff earn a commission on the branches they registered, for as long as
 * those branches keep paying, so this has to answer "which branches paid
 * in month X, how much, and who registered them" for ANY past month - not
 * just the current one.
 *
 * Branch name, staff name and the commission rate are deliberately
 * SNAPSHOT here rather than joined at read time:
 *   - BaseEntity carries @Where(is_active = true), so a soft-deleted
 *     branch or user silently disappears from a join and would take an
 *     already-earned commission row with it.
 *   - a branch can be renamed, or created_by corrected, after the fact.
 *   - changing the commission rate must never rewrite what was already
 *     owed for a month that has been paid out.
