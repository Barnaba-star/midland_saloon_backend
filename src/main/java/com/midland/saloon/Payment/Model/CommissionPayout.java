/**
 * A commission payout actually handed to a staff member for one month.
 *
 * Deliberately an amount rather than a "paid" flag: a month can still be
 * running when you pay, and another branch can pay into that same month
 * afterwards. Recording what was handed over lets the report show
 * due - paid = outstanding, so a top-up is a second row rather than a
 * choice between paying twice and not paying the remainder at all.
