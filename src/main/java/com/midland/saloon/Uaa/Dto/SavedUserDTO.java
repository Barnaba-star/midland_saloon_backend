 * What comes back from creating or editing a user.
 *
 * The activation code is here because the person being registered is usually
 * standing at the counter: whoever entered their details can read it out and
 * they can start work immediately, instead of everyone waiting on a text.
 * It is returned once, to the one caller who just created the account and
 * could re-issue it anyway - it is never stored in plain and never read back.
 *
 * Null when an existing user is edited; editing touches no credentials.
