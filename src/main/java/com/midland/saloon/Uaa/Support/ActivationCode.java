/**
 * The one-time code a new account signs in with.
 *
 * It replaces the first password rather than adding to it: a password sent
 * by SMS stays valid forever, so a message read months later still opens the
 * account. A code stops working - once it is used the account has a password
 * of its owner's choosing, and once it is old it is refused outright.
 *
 * Six digits, because it is read off a phone screen and typed on a phone
 * keypad. Six digits is only safe alongside the attempt limit in
 * UserController.login - a million guesses is nothing to a machine, and five
 * is nothing to a person who was actually sent the code.
